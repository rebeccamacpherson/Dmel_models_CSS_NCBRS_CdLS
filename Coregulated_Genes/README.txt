Relevant GEO Accession number: GSE213763

Directory: Coregulated_Genes

Files

sleep_activity_foranalysis
-- directory containing processed sleep and activity phenotype files, after elimination of dead flies, separation of day/night and activity/sleep from ShinyR-DAM output files.

sleep_activity_raw
-- directory containing raw Drosophila Acivity Monitor .txt files, trimmed for dates of experimentation, as well as a metadata file.

code_behavioral_analyses.txt
-- file containing SAS code and R code for analysis of the behavioral phenotypes (sleep, activity, and startle and tapping)

qPCR_knockdown.xlsx
-- quantitative Real Time PCR data to measure knockdown of coregulated genes, including delta-delta ct values for control and knockdown lines

Startle_Tapping.csv
-- file containing raw startle-induced locomotor response data, with time (seconds) the fly stays moving, as well as a bonary indication of whether the fly exhibited tapping behavior.
